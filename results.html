				AIMS
			</summary>
			<p>
				This work aims to discover the relationship between salience and lobby tactic choice for the development of tobacco control policies in the European Union.

		</details>

		<details open>
			<summary>
				METHODS
			</summary>
			<p>
				The research (1) measures variability in salience using <a href="data.html">mass media coverage and Google Trends metrics</a> to measure political salience, which (2) is later compared to findings about the tobacco industry involvement in the 2014 Tobacco Products Directive development process. The research differentiates between 5 types of lobby tactics: direct inside tactics, 3rd party tactics, outside tactics, legal threats and actions, and financial incentives.
			</p>
		</details>

		<details open>
			<summary>
				RESULTS
			</summary>
			<p>
				This study discovers that salience has little to no effect on the use of inside lobby tactics and has a detectable inverse relationship with the use of outside lobby techniques. Findings related to the other tactics are inconclusive.

				CONCLUSIONS

			<p>
				This work aims to discover the relationship between salience and lobby tactic choice for the development of tobacco control policies in the European Union.

			<p class="hypo"><b>H1</b><br>
			An increase in the issue salience makes inside lobby tactics, excluding the ones involving the employment of third parties, less likely to be used.

			An increase in the issue salience makes the employment of third parties more likely to be used.
