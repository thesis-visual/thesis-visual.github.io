			</summary>
			<p>
				This work aims to discover the relationship between salience and lobby tactic choice for the development of tobacco control policies in the European Union.
			</p>
		</details>

		<details class="test2">
			<summary>
				METHODS
			</summary>
			<p>
				The research (1) measures variability in salience using <a href="data.html">mass media coverage and Google Trends metrics</a> to measure political salience, which (2) is later compared to findings about the tobacco industry involvement in the 2014 Tobacco Products Directive development process. The research differentiates between 5 types of lobby tactics: direct inside tactics, 3rd party tactics, outside tactics, legal threats and actions, and financial incentives.
			</p>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>
				RESULTS
			</summary>
			<p>
				This study discovers that salience has little to no effect on the use of inside lobby tactics and has a detectable inverse relationship with the use of outside lobby techniques. Findings related to the other tactics are inconclusive.
			</p>
		</details>

		<details>
			<summary>
				CONCLUSIONS
			</summary>
			<p>
				The findings allow to expect a decrease in the pro-tobacco lobby actors' use of outside tactics during spikes in political salience around the legislative issue; it is reasonable to expect a reverse effect as well when salience is low. As for the inside lobby tactics (excluding third-party techniques), the analysis of the findings discourages from expecting to find a strong relationship between their employment by the tobacco industry and political salience in the future.
